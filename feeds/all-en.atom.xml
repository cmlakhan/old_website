&lt;p&gt;I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics] (http://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/&amp;gt;)at Harvard Medical School where I am mentored by &lt;a href="http://www.chiragjpgroup.org/"&gt;Chirag Patel&lt;/a&gt;.  Before coming to Harvard I was a Data Scientist at &lt;a href="http://www.hellowallet.com/"&gt;HelloWallet&lt;/a&gt;.  I also have a PhD in mathematics from &lt;a href="https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu/"&gt;North Carolina State University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Research Interests:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goals are to both build data infrastructure and methodological tools to understand the contribution of genetics and the environment to disease.  From the infrastructure side, I am interested in merging electronic medical records and publicly available environmental datasets to understand interplay between genes and the environment.  From a methodological perspective I am interested in utilizing tools from machine learning and statistical genetics to understand this question.  This also includes translating such methods to scalable software that can be easily used by medical practitioners on big datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
